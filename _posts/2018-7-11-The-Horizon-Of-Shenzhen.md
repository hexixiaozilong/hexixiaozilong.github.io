Fourty years ago, Shenzhen was a tiny tiny village. Today, Shenzhen is the third largest technology capital of the world. Let's have a nice and sweet look at this land.

I found this coffee house located at the 38th floor of a office building. Instead of coffee & coding combo, I decided to go with whiskey & coding. Afterall, when I get tired looking at the screen, I can relax my eyes with a stunning view of the Shenzhen City.

I'd recommend it as a good way to spend a relaxing weekend afternoon with your friends, whether you're playing card games or getting some work done. Here goes the link for the venue:
