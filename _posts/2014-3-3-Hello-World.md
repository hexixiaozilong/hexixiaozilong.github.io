title: The Horizon of Shenzhen

Fourty years ago, Shenzhen was a tiny tiny village. Today, Shenzhen is the third largest technology capital of the world. Let's have a nice and sweet look at this land.

I found this coffee house located at the 38th floor of a office building. Instead of coffee & coding combo, I decided to go with whiskey & coding. Afterall, when I get tired looking at the screen, I can relax my eyes with a stunning view of the Shenzhen City.

I'd recommend it as a good way to spend a relaxing weekend afternoon with your friends, whether you're playing card games or getting some work done. Here goes the link for the venue:

Dazhong Dianping: link
Baidu Map: link
Yelp: link
Google Map: link

Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
