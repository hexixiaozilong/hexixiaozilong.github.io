title: All The Way To The North
---

14 years in Chengdu. 3 years in Boston. 4 years in LA. The first 21 years of my life involved quite some moving, and again it's time to move -- Seattle.

Unlike before, this moving is a little different. First, I'm starting my first full-time job at Amazon; 9 to 5 life is nothing similar to student life, plus it's the frugal Amazon... Second, I'm financially on my own; damn I got to think twice before I clear out my shopping cart. Third, and most importantly, I gotta start from ground zero again; this means upwards is the only way to go.

To mark down this memorable moment, I decided to go on a ride by myself, driving from Los Angeles to Seattle. If anything, this trip north is more spiritual.

Of course I would forget about taking pictures on the way from LA to SF. I've done it too many times...

Past the bridges is the real face of North California: Freeways and nothing else. I had imagined the famous Napa Valley would've been somewhat more memorable ...

Once pass Sacramento, I'm entering the car-and-farm zone. Finally things got better when I pass Redding, because we are about to hit the mountains.

Roads are getting curvy. Hitting the 50-mile turn at 85 mph, I'm indulging in the force of eccentricity. Finally, I have enough adrenaline to stay awake!

Oops, I was hoping to enjoy some trees and mountains, but instead all I see is smoke. Damn, these Canadian wildfire...

Finally things got better when I enter Oregon. I begin to be able to see mountains through the dust.

Then, I stopped by Eugene, Oregon. That was where Nike founder Phil Knight went to school. Again I was disappointed. Such a small city and a lot of farms.

I ended my night at Portland. It's a day of 630 miles. Phenomenal. I picked a hotel in Beaverton, where Nike was founded. I gotta breath that Oregonian spirit.

Nike's Headquarters is Amazing. I will call it the highlight of the drive. It's amazing how such a small town can host this conglomarate mammoth. What's crazy is apparently LeBron James is hosting a charity tournament on Nike campus in the afternoon! Damn I missed him but it's ok, because he's LaBron now.

Keep going north, I hit Vancouver. Nevermind, it's a fake Vancouver, Washington.

So I stuck three suite cases into my tiny Porsche Boxster and I call it moving. Man, that's noobie move. Watch how Americans really move:

Okay, I need to document the first time when I see a blue sky during this drive.

And finally, I'm here. I don't feel too exciting; I don't feel too sad; I don't feel too different. I just feel ready.

Here I am, Seattle. Watch out for the storm.
